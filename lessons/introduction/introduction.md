**START THE SLIDES**

## WELCOME: Who Are Your Instructors?

- Well, there's me - Leighton Pritchard. I'll be teaching the `R` lesson on data management and visualisation.
- I'm a computational biologist
  - My research is entirely computational. I spend my days programming, analysing data, and working out how to make mathematics and computers represent biology more accurately
  - I've been programming for about 40 years, since the ZX81 came out and one of my schoolfriends' elder brothers got one.
    - I got a ZX81 in 1981, taught myself how to program in BASIC, and have been learning about computers ever since.
    - There are always new languages, techniques, and tools coming out.
    - I've never reached the end of any topic in computing - I'm always still learning how to code.
  - I've been a Carpentries instructor for about six years
    - I've taught across the UK, to groups of mathematicians, musicians, librarians, biologists, physicists, social scientists, and anyone else who is interested
    - I really like teaching the `R` lessons, because learners can get from never having programmed before to reading, cleaning, and generating complex visualisations of data in under a day.
    - I especially like how learners can go away with a new intuition and understanding of how to get computers to take the hard work out of data management and analysis. It's a really empowering skill, and it's great when I see their work later, and it's got cool data analysis in it.

- Your other instructor is Steve Ford
  - Steve, would you like to introduce yourself please?

- And we could not teach this course at all without the helpers, who are giving up their time to assist you on the course today.
  - Please would you all like to introduce yourselves:
    - Emma, Angelika, David, John, Alemao, Darren
  - The helpers will be your first point of contact throughout the day
  - If you have questions or issues, one of these kind people will be on hand to answer your questions, and keep you going through the course

## WELCOME: Prerequisites

- So what are we expecting of you, when you start this course?
  - We **do not** expect you to have *any* previous programming knowledge
  - We will be taking you through as though you are new to the subject
  - We **do** expect you to have installed the required software before you arrived
    - If you have not done this, please raise your hand in Zoom and a helper will assist you
  - The software you need for today is:
    - `git bash` (if you're on Windows - if you're *not* on Windows you can use a terminal window)
    - `RStudio` and `R`
    - a text editor (**NOT WORD!** - you need an editor that saves plain text, like `notepad++`; you *can* use `RStudio` for this)
  - For tomorrow's session, you will need to install `OpenRefine` on your machine
