# 1. Data Analysis


## Data-Intensive Research

- **Science and humanities are increasingly data-driven**
  - Early-career training has not prepared all researchers for this
  
<div class="highlight">
**Research Workflows**
</div>
- Enable systematic, replicable and reproducible work
  - Design principles
    - **Best practices** for data
  - Software development methods
    - **Automation** of repetitive calculations
 

## Pipelines and Workflows

<div class="highlight">
**Pipeline**
</div>
- What a computer does
  - A series of instructions
  - Data is *piped* through programs, and a result emerges

<div class="highlight">
**Workflow**
</div>
- What a researcher does
  - Exploring data, developing hypotheses, writing code, interpreting results
- Outputs include:
  - datasets, methods, teaching materials, software, papers, etc.
