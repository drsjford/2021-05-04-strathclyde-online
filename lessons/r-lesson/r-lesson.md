## 1. INTRODUCTION: WELCOME TO `R`

- Welcome to `R`!
- Working with a programming language (especially if it’s your first time) can be intimidating
  - But knowing even a little bit about `R` and how to manage and handle your own data is incredibly empowering
  - The rewards outweigh any frustrations.
   
- It's not a secret, but even experienced programmers find coding difficult and frustrating at times
  - I've been coding for 40 years and - though I know a bit more than when I started - every time a new language or technique turns up that I want to try, I'm a beginner all over again and feel like I know nothing.
  - So don't let intimidation stop you
  - With time and practice* it just gets easier and easier to accomplish what you want.

- Learning to code opens up the full possibilities of computing for analysing your data and automating your work
  - Think of it this way: if you could only do biotechnology using kits you bought off Sigma, you could probably get a lot done.
  - But - if you don’t understand the biochemistry of the kit - how can you tell it's not working? How can you troubleshoot?
  - And how could you do experiments for which there are no kits?
  - Knowing a bit of code lets you troubleshoot, and go beyond kits.

- R is one of the most widely-used and powerful programming languages in many areas.
  - R is specifically a statistical language, and particularly good for the generation of publication-quality graphs and figures.
  - Is is a general programming language, too. Most of the concepts you will learn apply to Python and other programming languages.
    - Once you understand the concepts in one language, it's easier to move across to other languages.

- However, R is not the easiest-to-learn programming language ever created.
  - Please don’t get discouraged! Some bits *are* just a bit more difficult than others
  - Even with the modest amount of R we will cover today and tomorrow, you can start using some sophisticated R software packages, have a general sense of how to interpret an R script, and be able to get your own data into a workable form for more sophisticated exploration.
- Get through these lessons, and you will be on your way to being an accomplished R user!

- The other big “secret” of programming is that you can only learn so much by reading about it. You have to do it - and get things wrong - to learn.
  - Do the exercises in class, re-do them on your own, and then work on your own problems, and you'll be expert in no time!
